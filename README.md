# Network Enumeration with Nmap  
This repository contains a comprehensive report and practical tasks completed as part of the Network Enumeration. The project focuses on utilizing the Nmap tool for various network scanning and enumeration techniques.

## Key Features
- **Host Discovery:** Identifying active hosts using different TTL values and ICMP echo requests.
- **Host and Port Scanning:** Exploring open ports and live hosts using advanced Nmap commands.
- **Saving Results:** Demonstrating how to save scan results in XML/HTML formats for further analysis.
- **Service Enumeration:** Gathering details about running services to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Nmap Scripting Engine:** Automating scans with pre-built and custom Nmap scripts.
- **Firewall and IDS/IPS Evasion:** Techniques to bypass detection systems during scans.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Nmap Commands:** Includes examples of `-sn`, `-sT`, `-sV`, `--script vuln`, and more.
- **File Conversion:** Converting Nmap scan results from XML to HTML.
- **Advanced Scans:** Scenarios using TCP, UDP, and reverse DNS resolution.
- **Firewall/IDS Evasion:** Employing fragmentation, timing, and traffic obfuscation techniques.

## Learning Outcome
This project enhances understanding of network security, scanning methodologies, and practical application of Nmap's robust features in penetration testing and security assessments.
